"""Typed append-only history — the model-visible record and its projection.

Wave 1 foundation (docs/roadmap.md "Wave 1 — the foundation"): the
model-visible transcript becomes a *projection* of a typed, append-only
record instead of a mutable ``list[LLMMessage]`` that hooks rewrite in
place.

- ``HistoryItem`` is the envelope: monotonic ``seq``, ``turn_id``, a stable
  ``<feature>.<name>`` content ``kind``, the payload ``LLMMessage``, and a
  ``token_estimate`` computed once at append time with the same estimator
  the compaction layer uses, so bounding and pressure checks never
  recompute.
- ``ContextManager`` owns the record. ``append()`` grows it;
  ``replace_all()`` is the ONLY rewrite path and is itself append-only: it
  records a ``CompactionBoundary`` declaring all prior items superseded,
  then appends the replacement items. ``projection`` renders the
  model-visible transcript — every item after the newest boundary.
- ``ContextFragment`` is the codex ``ContextualUserFragment`` counterpart
  (``codex-rs/context-fragments/src/fragment.rs``): injected content
  carries stable markers so it can recognise its own rendering in retained
  history — resume, compaction, and tests asserting what the model saw.

The record is the single source of truth for what the model saw; the
display event stream stays a separate, lossy view. Durable persistence (a
dedicated StorageAdapter channel) and O(tail) resume land on top of this
module in later Wave 1 steps.
