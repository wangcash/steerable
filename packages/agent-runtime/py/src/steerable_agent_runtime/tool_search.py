"""Discovery seam for the deferred tool tier.

Deferred tools are registered (dispatchable by name) but omitted from the
model-visible list, so the offered list stays bounded as registrations
grow. ``tool_search`` is how the model finds them: one direct-tier tool
that BM25-ranks the deferred inventory over name + description and returns
full descriptors. A match is immediately callable — dispatch never gated on
exposure — so discovery costs one tool round instead of a permanent list
slot.

Opt-in, same shape as the subagent seam: the host calls
`register_tool_search` and appends `tool_search_descriptor` to the loop's
tools list; routers without a deferred tier simply do neither. The
``progressive`` harness strategy wires both halves from
``AssembledHarness.wire_tools`` (see `harness_spec`).
